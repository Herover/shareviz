# Contributing

First, thanks for considering contributing!

This project does not (yet) have a formalized Code of Conduct, but you are generally expected to behave friendly when communicating here. Assume best intentions and ask questions when textual communication is too vague. It's also disallowed to be racist, LGBTQ+-phobic, sexist, xenophobic, or otherwise unkind to people on Data Tortilla communications platforms and elsewhere.

Checklist before contributing:

* Changes must have a issue on the Codeberg issue tracker. If you want to contribute something that's not there, please make a new issue to discuss the bug/feature request before you start working.

* Look at existing issues before submiting a new one.

* Avoid adding new packages for trivial stuff.

* Make sure to run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before commiting and creating pull requests.

* Don't submit AI generated code, and if you do make sure you understand every change yourself first.

* Please send sensitive information, ex. about security issues, on email to hi+git@leonora.app.
